Migrating Traq
==============

In order to upgrade to Traq 3.0, you will need to migrate your installation.

Migrating from Traq 2.3/2.4
---------------------------

If you are migrating from Traq 2.3 or 2.4, remove all files from the 2.x installation
and upload the contents of the `upload` directory in their place.

Rename the `htaccess.txt` file to `.htaccess`

Rename the `database.default.php` file to `database.php` in the `vendor/traq/config`
directory, then open it and enter the database details.

Open your browser and head to the location of Traq but append `/install/migrate.php`,
for example: `mysite.com/traq/install/migrate.php`.

From there follow the steps.

Migrating from Traq 2.0 to 2.2
------------------------------

You will need to upgrade to Traq 2.4 then migrate to 3.0.

Migrating from Traq 0.x
-----------------------

You will need to upgrade to Traq 0.6.1 then migrate to 2.0, then upgrade to 2.4
then migrate to Traq 3.0.

Why is migrating from 2.4 the only option?
------------------------------------------

Because only the latest version of Traq is supported.
