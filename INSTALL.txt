Installing Traq
===============

Installing Traq is quite easy, upload the contents of the `upload` directory
to where you want Traq to be run from on your server.

Rename the `htaccess.txt` file to `.htaccess`

Setup the database you want Traq to use and head to the installation directory
in your browser.

For example, if you uploaded Traq to `mysite.com/traq`, open `mysite.com/traq/install`
in your browser and follow the steps.

Depending on how your server is setup, you may be asked to create the config file
manually, simply copy the presented code on the last page of the installer and
paste it into the `vendor/traq/config/database.php` file, you will need to create
this file yourself.
